# Quick Start: Claude Gazette

In this guide you'll set up Claude Gazette to view AI-curated digests in a futuristic dark theme interface.

**Estimated time**: 5 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (check with `node --version`)
- npm or pnpm package manager
- At least one digest JSON file in `../outputs/web/` (generated by parent project)

## Step 1: Installation

```bash
cd /data/ClaudeRedditor/web
npm install
```

**Expected output**:
```
added 234 packages in 12s
```

## Step 2: Verify Digest Files

Claude Gazette reads digest JSON files from the parent project's output directory.

```bash
ls -la ../outputs/web/*.json
```

**Expected output**:
```
claudeia_2026-01-27.json
latest.json -> claudeia_2026-01-27.json
bookmarks.json
```

If no JSON files exist, generate one first:

```bash
cd /data/ClaudeRedditor
./reddit-analyzer digest --project claudeia
```

## Step 3: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output**:
```
  🚀  astro  v5.16.11 started in 245ms

  ┃ Local    http://localhost:4321/
  ┃ Network  use --host to expose
```

## Step 4: View the Site

Open your browser to [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

You should see:
- ✅ Dark blue background with cyan accents
- ✅ Subtle swarm animation (particles moving in background)
- ✅ Claude Gazette header with mascot
- ✅ List of digest cards

Click on a digest to see story cards with Claude expressions.

Click on a story card to see:
- Claude's expression (matched to story sentiment)
- "Claude's Take" section (reasoning for classification)
- Full story details with tags and metadata

## Step 5: Build for Production

When ready to deploy, build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Completed in 8.12s.

  dist/ ready to deploy
```

The `dist/` directory contains all static files ready for deployment to any hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## Next steps

- 📖 Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the boids algorithm and expression mapping
- 🎨 Customize the theme by editing `src/styles/global.css`
- 🤖 Adjust swarm animation by modifying `CONFIG` in `src/components/SwarmBackground.astro`
- 🔖 Manage bookmarks with CLI: `./reddit-analyzer bookmark add <story_id>`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No digests found" on homepage

**Cause**: No JSON files in `../outputs/web/` directory

**Solution**:
```bash
cd /data/ClaudeRedditor
./reddit-analyzer scan all --project claudeia --limit 50
./reddit-analyzer digest --project claudeia
cd web && npm run dev
```

---

### Problem: Swarm animation not visible

**Cause**: May have `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled in OS settings

**Solution**: Check System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce Motion (should be OFF)

Alternative: Increase opacity in `src/components/SwarmBackground.astro`:
```css
#swarm-bg {
  opacity: 0.30; /* Default is 0.20 */
}
```

---

### Problem: Build fails with "Cannot find module"

**Cause**: Dependencies not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

---

### Problem: Claude expressions not showing

**Cause**: Expression images not copied to `public/claude/` directory

**Solution**:
```bash
mkdir -p public/claude
cp /data/ClaudeRedditor/commenter_img/*.png public/claude/
npm run dev
```
