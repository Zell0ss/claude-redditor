## Python → Astro Cheatsheet

| Python/Flask/Django | Astro Equivalent |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `@app.route('/page')` | `src/pages/page.astro` |
| `@app.route('/post/<id>')` | `src/pages/post/[id].astro` |
| `render_template('page.html')` | Return `.astro` component |
| `{{ variable }}` (Jinja2) | `{variable}` |
| `{% for item in items %}` | `{items.map(item => ...)}` |
| `{% if condition %}` | `{condition && ...}` or `{condition ? ... : ...}` |
| `base.html` (template) | `Layout.astro` |
| Reusable template function | Component (`.astro` file) |
| `pip install package` | `npm install package` |
| `python app.py` | `npm run dev` |
| `requirements.txt` | `package.json` |
| `with open('data.json')` | `fs.readFileSync('data.json')` |

## Common Tasks

### Change site title
**File**: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
**Line**: 25
**Tutorial**: [7 - Making Changes](7_MAKING_CHANGES.md#1-change-site-title-and-logo)

### Change tag colors
**File**: `src/components/TagBadge.astro`
**Line**: 16-26
**Tutorial**: [7 - Making Changes](7_MAKING_CHANGES.md#4-change-tag-badge-styles)

### Modify story card
**File**: `src/components/StoryCard.astro`
**Tutorial**: [4 - Components](4_COMPONENTS.md#deep-dive-storycardastrо)

### Add a new page
**Tutorial**: [5 - Layouts and Pages](5_LAYOUTS_AND_PAGES.md#creating-a-new-page)

### Dark mode
**Tutorial**: [7 - Making Changes](7_MAKING_CHANGES.md#2-change-color-scheme-to-dark-mode)

## Key Concepts

### Astro is a Static Site Generator
- Reads your JSON files at **build time**
- Generates HTML files (no server needed!)
- Super fast for users (pre-rendered HTML)

### File-Based Routing
- Files in `src/pages/` become URLs
- `index.astro` → `/`
- `about.astro` → `/about`
- `digest/[id].astro` → `/digest/anything`

### Component-Based Architecture
- Break UI into reusable pieces
- Pass data via props (like function arguments)
- Compose components to build pages

### Utility-First CSS (Tailwind)
- Style with classes: `bg-blue-500 text-white p-4`
- No separate CSS files needed
- Consistent design system

## Resources

### Official Docs
- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

### In This Project
- Your current implementation: `web/src/`
- Configuration: `web/astro.config.mjs`
- Dependencies: `web/package.json`

### Help
- Ask Claude to explain any concept further
- Run `npm run dev` and experiment
- Check browser console for errors

## Tips for Python Developers

1. **Frontmatter is like Python**: The code between `---` is JavaScript, but works similarly to Python:
   ```astro
   ---
   // This is like Python code
   const items = data.map(x => x.value);  // Similar to: [x.value for x in data]
   ---
   ```

2. **Template syntax**: Use `{variable}` instead of `{{ variable }}`

3. **No colons after conditionals**: JavaScript uses braces `{}` instead of colons and indentation

4. **Type hints are optional**: TypeScript types are like Python type hints - helpful but optional

5. **Build vs. Runtime**: Astro runs at **build time** (like a static site generator), not runtime like Flask

## Next Steps After Tutorials

Once you've completed the tutorials:

1. **Experiment**: Change colors, layouts, add features
2. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to create production files
3. **Deploy**: Upload `web/dist/` to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
4. **Extend**: Add new pages, components, or features

## Questions?

As you work through the tutorials, you can ask Claude:
- "How do I...?" (specific task)
- "What does this code do?" (understanding)
- "Can you explain X in simpler terms?" (clarification)
- "Show me an example of Y" (examples)
